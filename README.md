# 🎓 Student Record Management System (Python + OOP)

A simple Python console project that manages student records using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Implemented

This project demonstrates all four pillars of OOP:

| Concept         | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Protected and private data members using getters and setters                       |
| **Abstraction**   | Used abstract class `Person` with `@abstractmethod` for interface-like behavior     |
| **Inheritance**   | `Student` class inherits from `Person`                                              |
| **Polymorphism**  | Method overriding: `show_details()` behaves differently based on the object         |
